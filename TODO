Things to implement in python-snes:
 - It's safe to call set_controller_port_device() anytime.
 - Add a parser/serialiser for bsnes movie files?
 - Replace the ctypes-based _snes_wrapper with a real C extension. Partially
   for simplicity, partially for the learning experience partially to include
   a fast 16-to-32-bit video converter.
