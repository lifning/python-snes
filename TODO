 - Integrate the following info into the docs:
   A BS-X slotted cartridge is a standard cartridge that happens to take
   a BS-X flash cart to extend the game.  A BS-X cartridge is the actual BS-X
   town cartridge, which has a special MMC, non-volatile PSRAM, and links to
   the Satellaview.

   It's technically possible to merge them into one function, but I didn't see
   a point. One of the big reasons to separate them is that the BS-X takes
   a single BIOS, so it's a good opportunity to save that and avoid having to
   ask the user to specify it all the time. BS-X slotted carts shouldn't
   interfere with that mechanism.
