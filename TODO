Things to implement in python-snes:
 - It's safe to call set_controller_port_device() anytime.
 - Add a parser/serialiser for bsnes movie files?

Things to pester byuu about:
 - Actually passing NULL as the slot data parameter to load_bsx,
   load_slotted_bsx, load_sufami_turbo or load_super_game_boy causes a segfault.
