Things to implement in python-snes:
 - Implement .wav recording/testing with the wave stdlib module.
 - Add a tool to convert BSNES movie files to/from a portable SNES movie format.
 - Replace the ctypes-based _snes_wrapper with a real C extension. Partially
   for simplicity, partially for the learning experience partially to include
   a fast 16-to-32-bit video converter.
 - Check whether we can load the 'supergameboy' library before loading an SGB
   cart.
 - Standardize API docs to refer to one 16-bit int as a 'sample', a left and
   right pair as a 'stereo sample', and reserve 'frame' for video output.
 - Modern libsnes doesn't necessarily reset controllers at every power-on.
   Update the docs.

Things to check:
 - Currently, the input_poll callback is called every frame, but the
   input_state callback is only called if the software running on the emulated
   SNES is checking for input (I think). I'd have expected that if the SNES
   wasn't checking for input, libsnes wouldn't call input_poll, so I'm not sure
   if this is deliberate or accidental.
 - What happens when you try and load save data (SRAM/RTC) into libsnes before
   loading a cart?
 - What happens when you try to load save data that's too large into libsnes,
   after loading a cart?
